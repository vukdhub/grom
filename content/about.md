About tools:
==========================

##This site was created with the help of the following tools:

- Pico CMS (Content Management System) based on PHP.
https://picocms.org. Pico is a "flat-file" CMS, meaning that it does not require a traditional database. Instead it stores content in flat files, making it easy to set up and deploy.
- Content is written in Markdown. https://www.markdownguide.org
- Pico uses the Twig templating engine https://twig.symfony.com
- HTML and CSS. And SCSS as a preprocessor scripting language that is interpreted or compiled into Cascading Style Sheets. https://sass-lang.com
- I write code in vscode studio. https://code.visualstudio.com
- For local server im using https://www.apachefriends.org apache server.
