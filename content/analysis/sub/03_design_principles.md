Design
=======================

Introduction

This work focuses on reviewing design principles in personal websites, such as blogs and portfolios. I will select and review a few examples, then reevaluate my own site based on these principles.

Selection
-----------------------

I selected three websites that I found interesting for this purpose. These sites are well-suited for evaluating design, and all of them are personal blog or portfolio pages. One of them is a site I visit frequently, and I want to take a closer look at how it holds up in terms of design principles. 

1. <a href="https://www.om.co">www.om.co</a>– A personal blog by Om Malik, where he shares insights on technology, media, and life.

2. <a href="https://www.anakras.com">www.anakras.com</a> – The portfolio site of Ana Kraš, a Serbian artist and designer, showcasing her multidisciplinary work, including photography, design, and art.

3. <a href="www.rikatillsammans.se">www.rikatillsammans.se</a>– A personal finance blog from Sweden, offering tips, advice, and discussions about managing money and investments.

Method
-----------------------

I will reference the article "Design Elements and Principles" by Mary Stribley, which outlines 20 key design principles.

4.1 
This website is a personal blog by Om Malik, a writer and technologist. He uses it to share his thoughts on technology, media, and life. The site also works like a journal, keeping his ideas and stories in one place for people to read.

4.2
The design is minimalist, with a clean layout that emphasizes the written content. It uses a monochromatic color ensuring the focus remains on the text. The typography is elegant and highly readable, which makes it look professional but still personal.

4.3
The minimalist design aligns well with the website’s purpose. By removing distractions, it helps the reader focus on the articles. The site feels calm and organized, matching the thoughtful style of the blog.

4.4
The design highlights principles of hierarchy and balance. For example, the typography size and spacing create a clear structure to follow, and there are no extra decorations to distract from the content.

4.5
The design is consistent across the homepage and subpages. The color palette and typography are uniform, ensuring smooth navigation and a cohesive experience.

4.1
This is Ana Kraš’s portfolio, where she shows her work in art, photography, and design. The goal is to present her creative projects to potential clients or anyone interested in her work.

4.2
The design is artistic and focuses on big pictures of her work. It uses a simple layout with large images and minimal text, placing emphasis on her work. It uses neutral colors to make her colorful projects stand out.
 
4.3
The design is highly effective for its purpose. By prioritizing visuals over text, it puts her work in the spotlight. The site feels modern, artistic, and professional, aligning perfectly with her brand.

4.4
The site uses contrast and emphasis. The big, colorful images stand out against the simple background. There’s also a lot of space around the content, making it easy to look at and not overwhelming.

4.5
The homepage has large visuals to grab attention, and the other pages look similar, with the same colors and fonts. This makes the site feel organized and easy to use.

- ###rikatillsammans.se

4.1 
The website is a personal finance blog aimed at educating readers about managing money and investments. The goal is to make financial advice easy to understand and help readers improve their money management skills. It also serves as a resource hub for readers to learn and discuss personal finance strategies.

4.2
The design is clean and professional, using a blue color scheme that feels wize and trustworthy. The layout is text-heavy, with a prominent header and long blocks of text below. Navigation is straightforward but somewhat basic, making it easy to access general sections but harder to locate specific chapters or topics.

4.3
The design mostly supports the site’s purpose by providing a structured way to present financial advice. However, the large header that takes up a significant part of the screen can feel overwhelming and distract from the content. Additionally, starting with long paragraphs of text might discourage readers who prefer a quicker, more dynamic introduction.

4.4
The site uses alignment and contrast well. Sections are organized clearly. However, the hierarchy could be improved to make it easier to scan and locate key topics. For example, the navigation could benefit from more detailed menus or a clearer structure to guide users to specific content.

4.5
The design is consistent across the homepage and subpages, maintaining the same color palette and typography.

##Analys



Analyzing these sites gave me a deeper understanding of how to critically examine design principles in a more structured and analytical way. The framework of design elements and principles provided valuable guidance as I assessed each aspect. While we often have an intuitive sense of how design can attract users, this process highlighted how deliberate choices influence user perception and interaction.

Design significantly impacts how users perceive the quality and reliability of a website, brand, or blog. It's not just about aesthetics—it’s about functionality, ensuring users can easily navigate and access the information they need. A well-designed site reflects professionalism and enhances the user experience, making it a key factor in achieving a website's goals. This analysis reinforced how important design is in shaping both usability and the impression a site leaves on its visitors.

What is notable is that all the sites follow design principles and pay attention to details. The most noticeable elements are color, repetition, balance, hierarchy, contrast, and typography, which all play a big role in the design of these three websites.

###My site

4.1 
My website is a portfolio to show my work and skills in web development and design. The main goal is to present my projects in a clear way to potential clients, teachers, or collaborators. It’s also a space for me to practice and improve my design skills.
I tried to apply some of the design elements and principles to improve my website. I chose a subtle color palette to make the content stand out while keeping it easy on the eyes. This approach emphasizes my work and written tasks. I also kept repetition in mind by using the same colors and styles consistently across all pages.

To make navigation easier, I used simple lines to separate sections like the header and main content. This helps visitors focus on each part of the page. However, I noticed that contrast and typography still need improvement. For example, the text color doesn’t stand out enough against the background, and the font size or style could be adjusted for better readability.

Overall, the design is minimalistic, with a focus on simplicity and clarity. While it works for now, I see room for improvement, especially in creating stronger visual contrast and enhancing typography for a more polished look.

###_"Design Elements & Principles" for my website:_

Throughout the previous stages of the course, I have already implemented several design principles such as line, color, repetition, and typography. For this project, I have made some adjustments to further improve the balance and hierarchy.
