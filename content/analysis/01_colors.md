Analysis of websites colors
=======================

Introduction

In this rapport, im diving into the colors of three websites: Norwegian (<a href="https://www.norwegian.com">www.norwegian.com</a>), National Geographic (<a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com">www.nationalgeographic.com</a>), and Pescanik (<a href="https://pescanik.net">www.pescanik.net</a>). The goal is to figure out what those colors are saying to us. I'll be using a simple method to look at their color palettes and connect the meanings.

Selection
-----------------------

1. ###Norwegian (<a href="https://www.norwegian.com">www.norwegian.com</a>)
    - Norwegian represents a classic airline website, I chose it because I recently visited it, it is very simple and easy to read, so I wanted to take a closer look at the colors and design.
2. ###National Geographic (<a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com">www.nationalgeographic.com</a>)
    - The national geography website has always seemed very powerful to me, it seems more like a web magazine than a classic website. It is interesting to see how they achieved this with the colors to appear prestigious and high class.
3. ###Pescanik (<a href="https://pescanik.net">www.pescanik.net</a>)
    - This site is one of the 5 sites that I visit regularly. I chose it because of its simplicity and clarity of content. The site is like a blog, with various articles from various fields accompanied by pictures.

Method
-----------------------

I will use the snapshot as a visual representation, and the <a href="https://www.colorzilla.com">ColorZilla</a> browser extension to dissect the color schemes. In addition, I will use the article <a href="https://elements.envato.com/learn/color-psychology#black">Color Psychology</a>, , as support in color analysis.

Results
-----------------------

###Norwegian

<img src="assets/img/norw.png" style="height: 300px; width:300px;"/>

Color palette:
<table style="border-spacing: 4px; border-collapse: separate">
<tr>
<td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color: #003251"></td>
<td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color: #D71839"></td>
<td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color: #F1F1F1"></td>
</tr>
</table> 

The deep blue (#003251) resonates with a sense of reliability and calmness. Crisp white (#F1F1F1), it evokes a sense of clarity and a contemporary touch, suggesting a seamless and sophisticated journey.   The bold red (#D71839) injects an element of excitement and energy, hinting at the thrill of adventure awaiting passengers. According to color psychology, this combination mirrors a harmonious blend, instilling a sense of confidence, clarity, and excitement in the Norwegian brand experience.

-Triad color scheme we can see on this site.

###National Geographic

<img src="assets/img/nat.png" style="height: 300px; width:300px;"/>

Color palette:
<table style="border-spacing: 4px; border-collapse: separate">
<tr>
<td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color: #000000"></td>
<td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color: #FECE04"></td>
<td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color: #FFFFFF"></td>
</tr>
</table>

The deep black (#000000) serves as a canvas, symbolizing mystery, depth, and the unknown realms waiting to be discovered. Contrasting with this darkness, the vibrant yellow (#FECE04) bursts forth, echoing the warmth of the sun and the energy of exploration. Together, they create a visual harmony that mirrors the delicate balance of nature. :D

-It seems that this is Side-Complementary color scheme.

###Pescanik

<img src="assets/img/pes.png" style="height: 300px; width:300px;"/>

Color palette:
<table style="border-spacing: 4px; border-collapse: separate">
<tr>
<td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color: #E68D1A"></td>
<td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color: #FFFFFF"></td>
<td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color: #000000"></td>
</tr>
</table>

Golden-brown (#E68D1A) for headers and titles exudes warmth and sophistication, signaling authority and inviting readers into a space of intellectual exploration.
White background, easy to read and focus on the text.

Analys
-----------------------

This analysis with the tools I used, and especially the color psychology article, gave me an insight into the meaning of color, which I did not know until now, or I rarely paid attention to them, or I did not notice them at all. Here I saw that the colors were not actually chosen randomly, by pairing what was nice to someone. However, color is actually the personal seal and identity of both an individual and an organization. With this analysis, I managed to touch on some of the points and meanings of colors in these everyday websites. For a larger analysis that I would do, there are much better sites than the ones I have chosen. The characteristics of colors are that each site utilizes color to reflect its thematic essence: Norwegian communicates trust and excitement in air travel, National Geographic: the wonders of nature, and Pescanik establishes an authoritative and serious tone for critical discourse.
